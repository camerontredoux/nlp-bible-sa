They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.",1,0.6514913439750671
2627,1SA.25.20,"As she rode on her donkey, and came down hidden by the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good. God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”",1,0.7785043120384216
2628,1SA.25.23,"When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off her donkey, and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground. She fell at his feet and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant. Please don’t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn’t see my lord’s young men whom you sent.",1,0.5428298711776733
2631,1SA.25.32,"David said to Abigail, “Blessed is the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me! Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand. For indeed, as the LORD the God of Israel lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”",2,0.8797619938850403

Behold, I have listened to your voice and have granted your request.” Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing until the morning light. In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.",1,0.5778946876525879

When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed is the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. The LORD has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.”
    David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself as wife. When David’s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.”",1,0.7618104815483093

David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.",1,0.8772658109664917

David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come. Then David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.",1,0.8950375914573669

Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.”",1,0.8317593336105347

The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let’s go.”",1,0.6486563682556152

Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain far away, a great space being between them; and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?”
    Then Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”",1,0.8067632913589478

For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king. This thing isn’t good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.” Saul recognized David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?”
    David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”",3,0.6722320914268494

Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.” David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and get it. The LORD will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because the LORD delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.",1,0.554230272769928

    So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. David said in his heart, “I will now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So I will escape out of his hand.”",2,0.7632867097854614

David struck the land, and saved no man or woman alive, and took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned, and came to Achish. Achish said, “Against whom have you made a raid today?”

    Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years? I have found no fault in him since he fell away until today.”",1,0.8577818274497986

For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men? Isn’t this David, of whom people sang to one another in dances, saying,
  ‘Saul has slain his thousands,
    and David his ten thousands’?” Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords don’t favor you.",1,0.6177622079849243
