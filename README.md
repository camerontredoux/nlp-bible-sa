#### Manual Labeling for Random Verses

Everyone should copy the random_verses.csv and append their name to it, then they should add a new column called sentiment, and for each row add a new value with their classification.

Classifications: positive, neutral, negative

For example:

,citation,verse,sentiment
6731,JDG.8.12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.",neutral
