Saul didn't say anything that day because he thought, “Something has probably happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—yes, he must be unclean.” But the second day, the day after the New Moon, David's place was still empty. Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to dinner either yesterday or today?”",1,0.7974357604980469

2588,1SA.20.34,"Jonathan left the table absolutely furious. He would not eat anything on the second day of the festival, for he was so upset by the shameful way his father had treated David.

He is in charge of your bodyguard, and highly respected in your family!” Ahimelech responded. “And was that day the first time he asked advice from God on his behalf? Of course not!

    “Yes, he'll come,” the Lord replied. “And will the town leaders of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?” David asked.
    “Yes, they will,” the Lord replied. So David and his men, who numbered around six hundred, left Keilah and moved around from place to place. When Saul discovered that David had escaped from Keilah, he didn't bother going there.",1,0.8437211513519287

9611,2CO.3.7,"However, the old way of relating to God, written in letters carved in stone, ended in death, even though it came with God's glory—so much so that the Israelites couldn't even bear to look at Moses' face because it shone so brightly, even though the glory was fading. If that was so, shouldn't the new way of relating to God in the Spirit come with even greater glory? If the old way that condemns us has glory, the new way that makes us right with God has so much more glory!",1,0.3933351933956146
9613,2CO.3.13,"We don't have to be like Moses, who had to put on a veil to cover his face so the Israelites wouldn't be dazzled by the glory, even though it was fading away. In spite of that, they had a hard, stubborn attitude. For right up until today when the old agreement is read, the same “veil” remains. Only through Christ can it be removed. Even today, whenever the books of Moses are read, a veil covers their minds.",3,0.6286903023719788
9940,2TI.2.8,"Focus your mind on Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, who was raised from the dead. This is my good news, and I'm suffering imprisonment because of it as if I were a criminal—but the word of God is not imprisoned. Despite all this I'm willing to keep on going for the sake of God's people so that they may gain the salvation of Christ Jesus that is eternal glory.",2,0.8207085132598877
9948,2TI.3.6,"They're the kind of people that slip into homes and take control of vulnerable women who are burdened down by the guilt of sin and distracted by all kinds of desires. These women are always trying to learn but they're never able to understand the truth! Just like Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these teachers also oppose the truth. They are people with corrupted minds whose supposed trust in God is a lie.",3,0.8659710884094238
9994,HEB.3.2,"He was faithful to God in the work he was chosen to do, just like Moses was faithful to God in God's house. But Jesus deserves much greater glory than Moses, in the same way that the builder of a house deserves more credit than the house. Every house has its builder; God is the builder of everything.",2,0.8246626853942871
9995,HEB.3.5,"As a servant, Moses was faithful in God's house. He provided evidence of what would be announced later. But Christ is a son, in charge of God's house. And we are God's house as long as we hold on with confidence to the hope we boast we believe in. This is why the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today,",2,0.6662155389785767
9998,HEB.3.14,"For we are partners with Christ as long as we hold on to our confidence in God from beginning to end. As Scripture says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't have a hard-hearted attitude like the time you rebelled against him.” Who was it that rebelled against God, even though they heard what he said? Wasn't it all those who were led out of Egypt by Moses?",2,0.6101607084274292
10002,HEB.4.7,"So God again sets a day—today—saying a long time later through David as he did before, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't have a hard-hearted attitude.” For if Joshua had been able to give them rest, God wouldn't have spoken later about another day. So a Sabbath rest remains for God's people.",1,0.6262668371200562
10021,HEB.7.14,"It's clear that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from this tribe. What makes it even clearer is when another priest appears who is similar to Melchizedek, and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by the power of a life that cannot be ended.",1,0.8057717084884644
10027,HEB.8.4,"Now if he was here on earth, he wouldn't be a priest at all, because there are already priests to present the offerings that the law requires. The place they serve is a copy, a mere shadow of what is in heaven. That's what God told Moses when he was going to set up the Tabernacle: “Be careful to make everything according to the blueprint you were shown on the mountain.” But Jesus has been given a far better ministry just as he is the one who mediates a far better agreed relationship between us and God, which is based on much better promises.",1,0.701100766658783
10036,HEB.9.18,"That's why the first agreement was established with blood. After Moses had given all the commandments of the law to everyone, he took the blood of calves and goats, and together with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, sprinkled the book itself and all the people. He said to them, “This is the blood of the agreed relationship that God has told you he wants with you.”",1,0.7300800681114197
10037,HEB.9.21,"Moses sprinkled the blood in the same way on the Tabernacle and everything used in worship. According to ceremonial law, almost everything is made clean with blood, and without shedding blood nothing is made ritually free from the stain of sin. So if the copies of what is in heaven needed to be cleansed in this way, the things in heaven needed cleansing by better sacrifices.",1,0.8366365432739258
10048,HEB.10.26,"For if we deliberately go on sinning after we've understood the truth, there's no longer any sacrifice for sins. All that's left is fear, expecting the impending judgment and the terrible fire that destroys those who are hostile to God. Someone who rejects the law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.",3,0.8321892023086548
10060,HEB.11.23,"Trusting in God, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born. They recognized he was a special child. They weren't afraid to go against what the king had commanded. Trusting in God, Moses, when he grew up, refused to be known as the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter. Instead he chose to share in the sufferings of God's people rather than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin.",1,0.6461870670318604

Because of their trust in God they conquered kingdoms, did what was good and right, received God's promises, shut the mouths of lions, put out blazing fires, escaped being killed by the sword, were weak but made strong, did mighty deeds in war, and routed enemy armies.",1,0.6452448964118958

10222,JUD.1.8,"Likewise these dreamers pollute their bodies, disregard authority, and insult heavenly beings. Even the archangel Michael, when he was arguing with the devil over Moses' body, didn't dare to condemn him with a slanderous insult, but said, “May the Lord rebuke you.” But these people ridicule whatever they don't understand; and what they do understand they instinctively follow like unthinking animals—this is what destroys them.",3,0.8855559825897217

He can open and nobody is able to shut, he can shut, and nobody is able to open: I know what you have accomplished—look, I've opened a door for you that no one can shut.

10311,REV.15.1,"Then I saw another amazing, important sign in heaven. Seven angels held the seven last plagues which complete God's judgment. I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Standing beside the sea of glass were those who had defeated the beast and his image and the number of his name. They had harps given to them by God and they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: “What you have done is tremendous and marvelous, Lord God, the All-powerful One.
