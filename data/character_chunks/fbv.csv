8408,LUK.7.36,"One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to come and eat with him. Jesus went to the Pharisee's house and sat down to eat the meal. A woman who was a sinner in that town found out that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house. She went there, carrying an alabaster jar of perfume. She kneeled beside Jesus and with her tears wet his feet, and dried them with her hair. She kissed his feet, and then she poured the perfume over them."
6527,JER.26.8,"As soon as he had finished telling everyone all that the Lord had ordered him to say, the priests and prophets and all the people grabbed him, shouting, “You'll die for this! How dare you claim to speak in the Lord's name here in the Temple and declare that it will be destroyed like Shiloh, and that this city will be left empty and abandoned?” Everyone crowded around Jeremiah threatening him in the Lord's Temple. When the leaders of Judah heard what happened they came from the king's palace to the Lord's Temple and sat at the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple to judge the case."
3390,2KI.23.5,"He also dismissed the priests appointed by the kings of Judah to present burnt offerings on the high places of the towns of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, those who had sacrificed to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the powers of heaven. He removed the Asherah pole from the Lord's Temple and took it to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem. He burned it there, ground it into dust, and threw its dust over the graves of the ordinary people. He also demolished the quarters of the cult prostitutes that were in the Lord's Temple, where the women used to weave tapestries for the Asherah pole."
9182,ACT.18.1,"Paul then left Athens and went to Corinth where he met a Jew named Aquila. Aquila was originally from Pontus, and had just arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all Jews expelled from Rome. Paul went to see them, and because they were in the same business of tent-making, he stayed with them."
489,GEN.48.16,"the Angel who has saved me from all kinds of trouble—may he bless these boys. May my name and the names of my grandfather Abraham and father Isaac continue through them, and may they have many descendants that spread throughout the earth.” Joseph was unhappy when he saw his father had put his right hand on Ephraim, so he took his father's hand to try and move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. “Not like that, father, this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head,” Joseph told him."
2822,2SA.17.17,"Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel because they couldn't be seen entering the city. A servant girl would come and tell them what was happening. Then they would go and let King David know. But a boy did see them and he told Absalom. So the two left immediately and went to the house of a man in the town of Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed into it. His wife took a cloth to cover the well and spread it out over the opening and then scattered grain over it. No one knew the men were there."
135,GEN.17.8,"I will give you and your descendants the whole country of Canaan—where you've been living as a foreigner—as land to own forever, and I will be their God.” Then God told Abraham, “Your part is to keep my agreement—you and your descendants for generations to come. This is my agreement with you and your descendants who come after you, the agreement you are to keep: every male among you shall be circumcised."
6263,ISA.58.2,"Every day they come to me, pleased to know my ways as if they were a nation that does what is right and follows the laws of their God! They ask me to treat them right; they like to be close to their God. “Didn't you see that we fasted?” they ask. “Didn't you notice how we denied ourselves?”
    That's because whenever you fast you still do whatever you want, and you treat your workers badly. Can't you see that when you're fasting you quarrel and argue, and end up having a vicious fistfight? When you fast like this you can't expect your prayers to be heard on high!"
9627,2CO.5.19,"For God was in Christ, bringing the world back from hostility to friendship with him, not counting anyone's sins against them, and giving us this message to change his enemies into his friends. So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God is pleading through us: “Please, won't you come back and be God's friend?” God made Jesus, who never personally sinned, experience the consequences of sin so that we could have a character that is good and right just as God is good and right."
6940,EZK.16.57,"before you were shown to be so wicked yourselves? Of course now you are mocked by the Edomites and the surrounding nations, as well as by the Philistines. Everyone around you looks down on you. You will have to experience the consequences of your immorality and your disgusting practices, declares the Lord. This is what the Lord God says: I'm going to punish you according to your sins, because you treated the promise you made with contempt by breaking the agreement."
